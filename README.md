## Describing your dataset and what data it contains:
This data set was obtained from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/real-estate-sales-2001-2018.

What are the dimensions of it (rows and columns), what are the various
columns, data types, etc. Describe it in sufficient detail so that an uninformed reader would
understand the dataset.

## The 2 questions the team generated and why they are interesting and important:
1. How many of each property sales were there by year
While simple at a glance, property sales is the back bone of economic development. By tracking overall property investment, we can make assumptions regarding the economic growth for each region. However an individual number does not have any merit to it, so we have decided to plot the number of property sales by year; this in turn allows us to have a relative metric to our data.
2. What is the average Assessed Value, Sale Amount, and Sales Ratio by year
Sales ratio is an adaptable metric determined by Assessed Property Value/Sales Amount. In combination with property sales, we can determine the impact of property sales on sales ratio. Whether sales ratio is increased during a point of property sales because of either increased assessment or a potential inverse where sale amount is lowered then assessed values because of economic downturn. From there, we can make estimates about economic factors by relating question 1 and 2.

## The manipulations applied to the data set as part of the analysis:
Were there any manipulations or calculations that needed to be performed on the data, what were
they, describe the purpose and how they were accomplished.

## Analysis and Results:
Analyze and visualize the results of your analysis and describe the implications of your analysis.
